    <h1>Keystone Species</h1>
    <p>
        A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keystone_species" target="_blank">keystone species</a> 
        is a species which has a disproportionately large effect on its natural environment relative 
        to its abundance, a concept introduced in 1969 by the zoologist Robert T. Paine. 
        <strong>
            Keystone species play a critical role in maintaining the structure of an ecological 
            community,
        </strong>
        affecting many other organisms in an ecosystem and helping to determine the types 
        and numbers of various other species in the community. Without keystone species, 
        the ecosystem would be dramatically different or cease to exist altogether.
